            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Undertale is a role-playing video game created by indie developer Toby Fox. The
                player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface
                of the Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player
                meets various monsters during the journey back to the surface. -

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Some monsters might engage the player in a fight. The combat system involves the
                player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent. They can opt to pacify or subdue
                monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them.
                These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Carrion is a horror video game developed by Phobia Game Studio and published by Devolver Digital.
                Described as a "reverse-horror game", the game allows players to control a tentacled monster whose
                objective is to make its way through a facility, stalking
                and killing humans in its path.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Players control a red, amorphous, tentacled monster (hinted at by the game as an unknown species of
                Tubifex worm). The monster must make its way through a facility, crawling through vents and killing
                scientists and soldiers. As the game progresses, players
                can obtain upgrades such as the ability to dash—which can be used to break through wooden barricades and
                access otherwise unreachable areas—and to grow in size.

            <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Plot:</li>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The titular organism is held in a containment unit within a research facility owned by a company called
                Relith Science. The creature breaks out and progresses through the facility in order to find an exit. As
                the organism progresses through the facility,
                it fights and devours its way through the facility's staff and security forces. Along the way, the
                creature discovers pieces of its genetic code removed by the scientists for study and containment, which
                allow it to evolve, allowing for
                greater size and more means of both defense and offense. The creature also encounters material analyzers
                which, upon entering, trigger flashbacks revealing its origins. The carrion was originally found in a
                dormant state of biomass by
                three scientists, and upon awakening, killed two and possessed the third. However, Relith security
                forces arrive and execute the remaining scientist, forcing the creature out. Eventually, the creature
                returns to its initial containment
                area and absorbs the last piece of its stolen genetics, allowing it to totally reconstitute a human form
                as the scientist it originally infected. The disguised creature then escapes the facility into what
                appears to be a partially quarantined
                Seattle.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                On the fictional Inkwell Isles, Cuphead and his brother, Mugman, are two fun-loving cups who live under
                the watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers enter the Devil's Casino
                and begin playing craps. When they go on a winning
                streak, the Devil himself offers to raise the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win one more roll, they
                will receive all the money in the casino; if not, the Devil will take their souls. Cuphead loses by
                rolling snake eyes, and he and
                Mugman beg for mercy. The Devil makes a deal with them: If the two can collect a "soul contract" from
                each of his runaway soul debtors by midnight the next day, he might let them keep theirs. They visit
                Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion
                that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest, but also warns them that the
                debtors may change physical form in an effort to stop them. The brothers travel around the Inkwell
                Isles, fighting the debtors in order
                to obtain their contracts. On entering the second island, the Elder Kettle notices that the duo are
                getting stronger from their battles, and informs them about "doing the right thing" when they come up
                against the Devil again. Once they
                have the contracts, they return to the Devil's Casino, but its manager, King Dice, blocks their way.
                Claiming that they have caused him to lose a bet with the Devil, he forces them to fight several of his
                henchmen before confronting them
                directly. After the brothers defeat King Dice, the player must choose whether to give the contracts to
                the Devil. If the player turns over the contracts, the Devil turns the brothers into his evil lackeys,
                and the game ends; if not, the
                Devil becomes furious at the brothers' refusal to honor their deal and fights them himself. Cuphead and
                Mugman triumph over him, burn the contracts and race home. Learning that they no longer have anything to
                fear from the Devil, the former
                debtors honor the brothers for their heroic actions.

            <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Gameplay:</li>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Cuphead's gameplay is centered around continual boss fights, interspersed with run-and-gun levels.
                Additionally, each world except for the final one includes a mausoleum level where the player has to
                parry ghosts before they touch an urn, rewarding the
                player with a Super move if completed. Each of these boss fights and run-and-gun levels is housed in one
                of four different worlds, with the fourth world containing the final fight against the Devil himself.
                Each boss fight includes a simple,
                normal and expert difficulty mode (with the exception of the final two, which lack a simple mode);
                defeating every boss on normal mode is required to complete the game, while expert mode is unlocked upon
                completion. While most bosses take
                place on land, several bosses instead are fought in aeroplanes in levels which play like side-scrolling
                Shoot 'em ups. The game also includes role-playing elements and a branching level sequence. Player
                characters have infinite lives,
                maintaining all equipment between deaths. Equippable weapons and special abilities known as Charms can
                be purchased from the shop using coins. Player characters feature a parry attack that can be used on
                certain objects marked in pink,
                to various effects, the most important of them being increasing a "super meter" that enables more
                powerful attacks. The super meter is represented by playing cards. The player can use an EX move with
                one playing card, with the move used
                depending on the weapon equipped. After completing a level, the player is ranked with a grade based on
                their performance, based on factors such as the time taken to complete the level, damage avoided, and
                number of parried attacks. The
                levels are accessible through a top-down perspective overworld with its own secret areas. The game also
                has a two-player local cooperative mode.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                A young woman named Madeline begins climbing Celeste Mountain, ignoring a warning from an old woman,
                named Granny (or Celia in the final chapter), who lives at the base. Madeline makes her way through a
                deserted city, where she can meet with a fellow
                traveler named Theo. Madeline camps out for the night and has a dream in which a dark reflection of
                herself, named Badeline, breaks out of a mirror, and attempts to stop Madeline's climb, but Madeline
                escapes from her and wakes up from
                her nightmare. Madeline continues into an old hotel on the mountain, where the hotel's ghostly
                concierge, Mr. Oshiro, tries to persuade Madeline to stay despite the dingy condition of the hotel. She
                reluctantly entertains him by cleaning
                part of the resort, but he is keen on having her stay for a night. This leads to Badeline reappearing
                and creating an escape for Madeline, but insulting Oshiro in the process, enraging him. He chases
                Madeline out, and Madeline continues
                the climb. After traveling through the Golden Ridge, Madeline meets up with Theo at a gondola. Badeline
                appears again and stalls the lift, giving Madeline a panic attack. Theo calms her down, and the gondola
                moves again, arriving at an
                ancient temple. Theo ends up separated and trapped inside a mirror. Later, Theo gets encased in a magic
                crystal and monsters given form from Madeline and Theo’s insecurities attack them. She finds Theo and
                frees him from the crystal. Madeline
                then carries Theo out of the temple. After breaking Theo's crystal and escaping from the temple,
                Madeline and Theo set up camp. Madeline tells Theo about the reflection and confides in him about her
                mental health issues before resting.
                During the night, she seeks out Badeline and expresses her wishes to leave it behind. This angers
                Badeline, and forces Madeline to plummet down to the base of the mountain. Stuck in a cave at the bottom
                of the mountain, Madeline meets
                the old woman again, who suggests that Badeline might be scared and says that Madeline should try
                talking instead of abandoning it. Madeline searches for Badeline again, apologizes for pushing it away
                and vows to climb the mountain together.
                Badeline initially lashes out at Madeline, but relents and forgives her. Badeline and Madeline merge
                together, and they work their way back up the mountain, before finally reaching the summit. An epilogue
                shows Madeline celebrating her
                success with her friends by eating strawberry pie. The pie will be larger and contain more or less
                strawberries depending on how many strawberries the player collected throughout the game. In two
                post-ending chapters, Madeline explores
                the core of Celeste Mountain a year after the main story in the chapter "Core", and copes with missing
                the funeral of Granny, now known as Celia, in the chapter "Farewell".

            <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Gameplay:</li>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Celeste is a platform game in which players control a girl named Madeline as she
                makes her way up a mountain while avoiding various deadly obstacles. Along with jumping and climbing up
                walls for a limited amount of time, Madeline has the ability
                to perform a mid-air dash in the eight cardinal and intercardinal directions. This move can only be
                performed once and must be replenished by either landing on the ground, hitting certain objects such as
                replenishing crystals, or moving
                to a new screen (although the player is granted a second dash later on in the game). Throughout each
                level, the player will encounter additional mechanics, such as springs that launch the player or
                feathers that allow brief flight, and
                deadly objects such as spikes which kill Madeline (returning her to the start of the room). Players can
                also access an Assist Mode, where they can change some attributes about the game's physics. Some of
                these include: infinite air-dashes,
                invincibility, or slowing the game's speed. Hidden throughout most "A-Side" chapters of the game are
                optional strawberries, obtained through challenging platforming or puzzle solving sections, which
                slightly affect the game's ending depending
                on how many are collected, as well as a cassette tape that unlocks a "B-Side", which provides harder
                platforming puzzles using the mechanics introduced in the A-Side. Optional "crystal hearts" used to
                access post-game content are also
                found in each A-side. Beating all the B-Sides then unlocks the "C-Side" versions, which are very hard
                but short stages which expand further upon the mechanics in the A- and B-Sides. B-Sides, C-Sides, and
                the Farewell DLC chapter all teach
                the player more complicated movement techniques that are needed to clear otherwise impossible obstacles.
                Upon clearing all C-Sides, the player can access the Variants menu, which allows players to change the
                game's physics in a way similar
                to the game's Assist Mode. Some of these "variants" include: speeding the game up, 360 degree dashing,
                and low friction. These serve to make the game both more challenging and fun. The original Celeste
                Classic Pico-8 prototype can also
                be found as a hidden minigame.</p>
